Accomplished research scientist with extensive experience in imaging, image processing, and volumetric data analysis. With a PhD in Physics from the University of Jyväskylä, I develop computational tools for scientific imaging, particularly in X-ray tomography. My work focuses on automated image processing pipelines and integrating machine learning to enhance microscopy and tomography analysis. I specialize in image processing, reconstruction, and analysis for large-scale volumetric datasets.
